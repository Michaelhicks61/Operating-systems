Memory managment of an operating system is where it takes the 2 kinds of memory( Primary and Main memory) and manages them. 
The OS decides which the order that processes gets ahold of this memory and how long.
When a process requests The OS it gives it access to the memory the stops it whem it is done like the on and of switch.

Another procces of an OS is Security. It uses passwords to protect the data a user has on his computer. It also stops anyone trying to access this data or programs that is not supposed to. This is important because most failure in hardware comes from becasue with all the perifreals having access there needs to be something that can keep things that could disturb it out.
